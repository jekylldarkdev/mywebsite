# How to safely access the Dark & Deep web 
> Even if you use the internet on a daily basis – writing emails and styling with your YouTube skills – there may still be uncharted lands on your Internet map. What if I told you that you can only see a fraction of the things the Internet has to offer? 

Beneath the surface, there is a much deeper layer that is inaccessible via your common browser – the dark web and deep web. But accessing this part of the net is not very safe unless you take certain precautions. So make yourself comfortable in your seat and learn how you can safely access the Dark and Deep web.

## Guide on how to access the Deep and the Dark web safely
Your connection with Tor passes through three publicly hosted nodes chosen randomly before reaching the intended website. However, many users prefer to opt for additional measures to go the extra mile when it comes to privacy. 

There are many options to pick from: for an additional privacy-minded OS like Tails, Qubes OS or Whonix, burner laptops, etc. Finally download Tor browser from [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

## Know your goal
It doesn't take much IT knowledge to realize that the Deep web (and especially the Dark web) is a pretty dangerous place. Especially if you don't know what you're doing and only go there to satisfy your morbid curiosity. 

So, you have to know what exactly you are going to do there so that you don't end up being a victim of a hacker with all of your personal info exposed (which is much more likely than on the surface web). 

## Take safety precautions
You have to take into consideration all the applications that are currently running on your computer.
For example, you should close all the apps that you have accounts for. This includes your password manager, streaming applications like Netflix, and storage apps like OneDrive. 

You might even think about closing everything that's not essential for browsing the Deep web. Also, you should cover your webcam (if you're not doing this already) and turn off the location on your device. In addition to all this, you must have a quality antivirus software tool installed.

## Check for IP leaks
Even though you have everything set up, there's still something to be done, and it's checking whether you have any leaks that could reveal any personal info about you. Basically, you have to check for IP, DNS, and WebRTC leaks. For this, you should head to ipleak.net and dnsleaktest.com. 

There, you should check whether the IP address displayed is your real one or the one provided by Tor.
